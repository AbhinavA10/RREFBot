## RREF Robot

This is a repository for our GENE121 (programming) course final project.

It is a robot that uses a color sensor to scan a page containing a printed 2x3 matrix.

The robot recognizes digits in the scan and performs a gauss jordan reduction algorithm.

Finally, the robot draws the solution onto a whiteboard.
